    "### 1.1 Definition of Exoplanets \n",
    "To give a short definition of an exoplanet one would say it is a planet outside the solar system. Hence the also popular name \"extrasolar planet\". Although the IAU has never officially agreed on a standard definition there are some statements they agreed on. \n",
    "1. The minimum size and mass are defined equally in exoplanets as in the solar system: ability to clear their orbit and the overcoming of external forces by sufficient self-gravity. \n",
    "2. Masses must lay below the minimum mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (around 13 Jupiter masses). Anything above this limit is called a brown dwarf.\n",
    "3. These objects must orbit stars or stellar remnants. Bodies with masses < 13M<sub>J</sub> that are free-floating in young star clusters are not considered to be planets but sub-brown dwarfs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first exoplanet to be discovered by using the radial velocity method is 51 Pegasi b. This exoplanet was discovered in 1995 by Mayor and Queloz. In this method, the mass of the exoplanet and its influence on the orbital motion of the host star is being analyzed in the context of its spectra. Due to the additional mass of the exoplanet, the host star’s orbital motion around its mass center changes. Now, because of this, there are some changes visible in the spectra of the host star. Those changes are, for example, periodic blue or redshift. This shift in a spectrum in combination with movement is called the Doppler effect.\n",
    "One of the downsides of this detection method is the detection of the exoplanet’s mass. Since the detected mass is always the minimum mass of the exoplanet, and its real mass can be way bigger than previously detected mass. Due to that, the changes in the orbital motions of the host star around its mass center are also not exactly detectable, and neither are its spectra changes. Another downside of the radial velocity method is the need for a very high-resolution spectrograph since changes in the spectra are often hardly detectible due to the changes being relatively small.

    "### 1.3 Present\n",
    "\n",
    "Present experiments and missions concerning the detection of exoplanets and their systems are being focused on the precision of the radii measurements. This is achieved with the combination of the radial velocity method and the transit method. Because of this combination, the radius of the host star can be detected more precisely, and with that, the exoplanet’s radius gets detected more precisely as well. The combination of those two detection methods also solves the problem of the exoplanet’s orbit inclination, which occurred in the radial velocity method. An example of such a mission is the California Kepler Survey (CKS), which uses the High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES).\n",
    "Another important research is concerning the exoplanets’ orbit. It has been figured out that an exoplanet’s orbit can change over time. This can happen due to planetary scattering. Planetary scattering can only happen if at least two exoplanets orbit the same host star. If their orbits cross each other and following on from that collide. One of the exoplanets gets pushed away from the host star leading to an expanding orbit, and the other one gets pushed towards the host star leading to an increased orbit. [(Chien-Hsiu Lee 2018)](#ppf)<br>\n",
    "Also, the James Webb telescope was launched on the 25th of December 2021. Unlike its predecessor Hubble, it orbits the second Lagrange point. Its missions are wide-ranging but it also studies far-away solar systems which might support life similar to Earths. Below the first direct image of an extrasolar planet can be seen. \n"

    "Several missions for the further or more precise discovery of exoplanets are planned and in the making. As an example, the Planetary Transit and Oscillations of Stars mission (PLATO) is planned to start in 2026. This telescope will be specialized in the detection and research of very bright stars and their exoplanets. Another example is the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), which is set to start in 2027. This telescope is built to have an incredible spatial resolution and will be discovering and analyzing exoplanets using the microlensing method. [(Chien-Hsiu Lee 2018)](#ppf) "

    "### 1.5 First discovery of an exoplanet\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 1992, a landmark discovery shook the world of astronomy and astrophysics with the announcement of the first extrasolar planets ever observed. These exoplanets were detected orbiting the millisecond pulsar PSR1257+12. This discovery was made known through the letter titled \"A Planetary System around the Millisecond Pulsar PSR1257+12\" by Aleksander Wolszczan to Nature and a press release issued by Cornell University, which marked a pivotal moment in the exploration of exoplanets.\n",
    "These newfound planets were identified through a technique called the pulsar timing method. By meticulously measuring the timing of radio signals emitted by the pulsar PSR1257+12, astronomers observed variations that were attributed to the gravitational influence of planets orbiting the pulsar. These observed pulsar period measurements over a few years were compared to the construction of a time model that included non-interacting Keplerian orbits and fitting it to the data, along with standard pulsar parameters [Figure 2](#pulsar). This approach allowed astronomers to deduce the properties of the detected planets and their orbits with a high degree of confidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Observed pulsar period measurements + period changes predicted by a two-planet model*\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery revealed two (or possibly three) planets with masses of 2.8 and 3.4 Earth masses, which was particularly intriguing because these planets were located in extremely close proximity to the pulsar. Their distances were about 0.47 and 0.34 AU. The most extraordinary aspect of this discovery lay in the unconventional environment where these planets were located, it was widely believed that planets could not exist around such exotic and hostile objects. The discovery prompted a reevaluation of our understanding of planetary formation and the remarkable diversity of planetary systems that might exist in the cosmos and raised questions about the diversity of planetary systems in the universe.\n",
    "In summary, the 1992 discovery of exoplanets orbiting PSR1257+12 was a transformative event in exoplanetary science. It marked the first confirmed detection of planets beyond our solar system and challenged our understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of planetary systems in the universe. This pivotal moment set the stage for continued investigation, offering the promise of deeper insights into these exoplanets and the extraordinary environments in which they exist. [(A. Wolszczan 1993)](#first)"
